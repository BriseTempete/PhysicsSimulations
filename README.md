# PhysicsSimulations
Simulation of Bose-Einstein rotating condensat

This code runs on Python 2.7, make sure you have the good version. 

Put the code and the noeud40.txt in the same folder. At line 32 initialize the string path to the path of noeud40.txt in your computer. 
Run the entire code, then change parameters from line 322 to 331 to see the effects of your changes. The programm must print images of rotating vortex.
